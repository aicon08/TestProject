# TestProject
test of new project--Assignment #3

A test R package was created as part of the assignment for Prof. Crump's lab. This package contains a series of functions along with their descriptions.
Assuming this packgage was part of the global options, to load this package you would need to use the library function [e.g. library(TestProject)].
