# TestProject
test of new project--Assignment #3

A test R package was created as part of the assignment for Prof. Crump's lab. This package contains a series of functions along with their descriptions.
Assuming this packgage was part of the global options, to load this package you would need to use the library function [e.g. library(TestProject)].

Considering this is NOT part of the global options, the next best thing would be to clone or download this package from Github. Since this is not private code, you should be able to access it via the clone or download option and either choose to download it in a Zip file, or open directly on your desktop.

Note: Github Desktop is needed for the "Open directly on your desktop" option. 
Note2: Download Zip file will save the zipped file directly in your downloads folder.

Downloading Zipped File:
Unzip the file and save it in the desired location
Open up RStudio and choose to load a project
select TestProject.Rproj file to load into your workspace
Done! This will automatically load all of the affiliated files onto your RStudio environment.
